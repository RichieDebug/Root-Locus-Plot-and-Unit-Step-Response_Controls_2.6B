# Root-Locus-Plot-and-Unit-Step-Response_Controls_2.6B
Plot the root locus of the system transfer function by  MATLAB and compare the result with your analytical plot in part (a).   Based on the obtained MATLAB root locus plot in part (b),  determine a controller gain ùêæ such that the closed-loop response of the system is stable  and satisfies the following specifications:  ÔÇ∑ Maximum overshoot: under 5%  ÔÇ∑ Settling time (within 2%): under 20 seconds  ÔÇ∑ Rise time (from 10% to 90%): under 10 seconds  ÔÇ∑ Peak time: under 20 seconds    Write a MATLAB-Simulink program to simulate and obtain a unit-step response of the  closed-loop system in Figure 5, and then clearly show that the closed-loop response  actually satisfies the specifications above by using the stepinfo command in MATLAB.  Please remember to label the axes and title the plot.
